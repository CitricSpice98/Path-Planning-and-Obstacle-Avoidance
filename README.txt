Given the 2 d representation of a map world ( see map.txt) with a spawn location for the robot simulator within the boundaries of the map,
I have implemented the A star path planning algorithm to reach the goal state and avoid the obstacles and boundaries ( denoted in the map as 0 ).
Pre- requisites
1. Robot simulator. ( This experiment was performed with turtlebot3 simulator)
2. ROS
3. Python
4. Optional ( Virtual Machine)

How To Run

Launch the simulator Environment and Python Code from the launch file.
